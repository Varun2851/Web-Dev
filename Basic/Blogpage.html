		Founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994, Amazon has now become the world’s most valuable public company. Started as an online bookstore in a small garage; Amazon has now expanded its business into e-commerce, music, entertainment, web hosting business, etc. Whether you want to listen to music or read a book or shop for clothes or watch a movie; name any service, Amazon has got you covered. With a mind-blowing worldwide presence, Amazon is now the world’s largest online retailer across the world. With dozens of offices operating in over 30 nations across the world, Amazon is a hub of opportunities for students and professionals, in particular from the field of engineering and technology.

		<br>
		Though the most preferable choice for almost all engineering graduates, it is not a cakewalk to be hired at Amazon.
		<br>
		<br>
		In 2019, Amazon received over 2 lac job applications for 30k job openings.
		<br>
		<br>
		Amazon has multiple levels of hiring processes. The process begins with an online assessment to test the candidates’ work styles and leadership qualities. Amazon gives considerable weightage to its Leadership Principles and looks for the same qualities in each candidate as a prerequisite. The online assessment is then followed by a telephonic interview to test behavioral aptitude. Once the first two rounds are cleared, you get to sit for the in-person interview at Amazon. It is during the in-person interview that the candidates are interviewed for technical rounds.
