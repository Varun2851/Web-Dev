	    	<p>
	    	A paragraph &nbsp &nbsp is a number of sentences grouped together and relating to one topic. Or, a group of related sentences that develop a single point.
	    	</p>
	    	
	    	<p>
			This definition shows that the paragraphs of compositions are not mere arbitrary divisions. The division of a chapter into paragraphs must be made according to the changes of ideas introduced.

	    	Before we start the DBMS Tutorial, we need to have a clear insight into what Databases are. Let us say that you’re working in a corporation where there are about a million employees scattered across the globe. Every employee will have a Unique Employee ID, a job role, a manager who the employee is working under, a ‘hire’ date and a ‘termination of contract’ date, and a particular amount of salary.

	    			Now it is not impossible to make tables, categorize the data, write a million entries down into one long sheet of paper, but it is rather unethical. This is why Databases officially came into existence in the 1960s.

	    			<p>
	    				A Database is an electronic form of the ‘unethical long sheet’. This Database can now be broken into parts, related to one another, sorted by different variables, and can even be compared to each other. Let’s say that you want to compare the salary of employees, having the same job role and years of experience.

	    			<p>
	    				Now that we have a clear insight on what Databases are, we can start discussing DBMS (Database Management Systems). You might have heard of MySQL or Microsoft Access. These are two out of the many Database Management Systems. These are software that allow you to store data, fetch data and retrieve it and also allow you to run queries on Databases.

	    				All of us have heard of Spreadsheets. It lets us create tables, enter data, perform calculations on the data in the cells, and write mathematical functions. You can also maintain multiple worksheets, relate the data amongst the worksheets, even during calculation. So why not use just spreadsheets then? Why rely on SQL commands to operate on the same tabular data using a Relational DBMS? Since both works on tabular data, people think that they are interchangeable, but it is not so.

	    				<p>

						Let’s say that you join a company that has a Dataset for its employees containing ‘Unique Employee ID’, a ‘job role’, a ‘manager’ who the employee is working under, a ‘hire’ date, and a ‘termination of contract’ date and a particular amount of salary.

	    				During a placement interview, you will definitely be asked to answer questions about DBMS. In order to ace your placement interview, it is necessary to know about DBMS. You can definitely take up a DBMS course for placement, you can take up a DBMS course online, or join an institute that will train you in DBMS. The courses will prepare you for the questions asked on DBMS in software engineering interviews. You need to practice running SQL commands on Databases to get a better understanding of DBMS.

						Most of the questions asked in interviews for the position of a Database Engineer are on SQL (Structured Query Language) commands and RDBMS terms like, ‘What are Joins?’, ‘What are the fundamentals of SQL commands used when running a query?’

						So what are the fundamentals of SQL commands used while running a query?
